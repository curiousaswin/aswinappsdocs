             <b>SLIDE NOT WORKING PROPERLY</b><br>
             It might be that you reused a slidename, leaved a slide name blank, you left spaces, you used special characters. If you used special characters or left spaces, you can fixed this easily by clicking the remove slide. Otherwise, you would need to refresh the page.<br>
             <b>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SAVE AND SAVE AS FILE?</b><br>
             The difference is that the save button saves the presentation to browser storage and the save as file downloads the file. Please note that the presentation name is required. You have to import the file when you open the masterslide again.<br>
             <b>GRADIENTS NOT COMING PROPERLY ON EXPORT</b><br>
             On export, we currently only have support for linear gradients. We are currently working on this fix.<br>
             <b>IMAGE/VIDEO NOT SHOWING UP</b><br>
             If the image does not show up, it might be that you did not choose its orientation which are portrait and landscape. You can also adjust the width and height before you add them.<Br>
                 <b>HOW TO ADD ADDITIONAL TEMPLATES</b><br>
                 You go to import and insert the ams file and press on load selected file.

The slide name should not contain spaces, special characters, and you should not reuse any slide names. If you bypass them and get problems, see the answer in the help center. Next, choose template. If you press on heading and paragraph you will get a heading and a paragraph. I think you got it how the templates work.After that, you can add the content.

<b>BACKGROUND</b><Br>
We have a background color picker to change the slides background. You have to write the slide name in the top text box. We also give a option for gradients. We have 3 gradients which are : linear,radial, and conic. The linear gradient comes with 2 colors. The radial and conic  gradients comes with 3 colors. The gradients come in this order : 1,2 or 1,2,3.

Our transitions work differently. Our transitions actually affect the elment not the slide. When you press the transitions collapse, you will be given a list of transitions. Almost all of our transitions are useful.
